# Bank account management system
# Developed by Ben Pentecost, Ben Braniff, and Christian Peretz

Our program is a bank account management system that is designed to be as user friendly as possible. 
In order to use the program, launch the FinalProject.jar file.
Doing so will open a window asking for a username and password.
The defualt username is "bpentecost" and the default password is "password"
Once you enter this information you will be able to access a window with all user information.
Information included is name, account number, account type, and user balance
You are also able to deposit and withdraw a select amount of money.
If you want to logout, just hit the "logout" button under the balance lable!
